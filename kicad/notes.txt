Startup sequence:

At startup, all GPIO lines will be in input mode; /COL_ENABLE and /ROW_ENABLE will
be pulled high, diabling the row and column lines. The low-side lines coming out of
the shift registers will be inactive, but the high-side lines have pullups going into
the high side drivers. Both row and column high-side drivers will be active. No current
will flow in the coils.

The column driver boards have 32 lines coming from the shift registers.
Since the panels the boards are plugged into come in varying sizes
(20, 25, and 30 columns at least), and can be daisy-chained together in any
order, the first task is to determine how many columns there are in all, and
then determine where the "empty" positions are.

At startup, both the column and row drivers are all in the high-side active state. The
first step is to turn off all the row drivers (neither high or low side active). Do
this by shifting out 16 pairs of 0 followed by 1. The 0 turns off the low side drive
(making it float) and the 1 pulls down the corresponding bit in the shift register,
which turns off the high side drive. As long as any column driver is high, the column
presence sense line /SENSE will be active (driven low). We count the total columns by
shifting bits to turn off columns one by one until /SENSE goes high, indicating no more
columns are active.

Now we can determine the column positions by turning on the column high side drivers
one at a time, and checking the /SENSE line. This involves initially shifting in two
bits (00) to disable the low driver and enable the high driver of the first column, and
checking the sense line. Then shift out a (0, 1) pair to deactivate the first column
and activate the next. Repeat for each remaining column, whose number was determined
above.
