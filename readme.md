# Annax Flipdot Driver #

This is a driver for Annax flipdot display panels, with an ESP8266 (Wemos D1 Mini) controller.

**This project is unfinished**

The controller consists of a row driver PC board, which contains the controller, and a
column driver PC board. A span of panels can be any length. One row driver daisy chains
to all the panels, and each panel has its own column driver. The drivers are connected
together with a serial interface.
